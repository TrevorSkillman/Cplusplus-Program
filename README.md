# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem is was solving.
In this project which was the final project for my C++ course. With starter code that we were given from the school to help work with grocery tracking system using two different programming languages one being C++ and the other Python. From a text file I created for the project which is a list of food items showing multiple times in the list, that was to be read by both C++ and Python, then creating Python functions that involve the .txt file which those functions are then called in my switch statement of the .cpp file. There are 4 options in a display menu for the user to choose from. The first option allows the user to see the entire list of food items and how many times they appear on the list, the second option asks the user to put a singular food item to output that item and how many times it appears on the list. The 3rd option outputs a colored histogram for the user of the entire list on the .txt file, but in order for that to happen I had to create a function in Python that creats the .dat file. Option 4 then lets the user quit out of the program.

# What did you do particularly well?
Well there is a reason I chose this project, one being that it was so very difficult for me to complete. I was able to smoothly create my functions but was having some issues with debugging my program to get it work. I feel the experience I gained just from this project alone and going into the thick of it when debuggging, its like I was understanding certain things at different "point of view", I am so thankful for that it was so difficult because of the things I picked up and learned while debugging and it will help boost my confidence in future courses and hopefully a programming job down the road.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Now that I think of it, after its all said and done. I think I could of created one big driver to do the load of the brunt work, for example putting my display menu and switch statements inside a driver function, and then call that single function in Main() of the .cpp file. I think in the long run it would of made extremly quick work when calling the one function that holds the meat and potatoes of the program that we are looking for.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I had a very difficult time with my 3rd switch statement that calls the python function for the histogram, upon creating the function and trying to call that python function in the .cpp file it would never show for me, I then had to speak with a tutor about it and they took the time and assited me in researching the issues I was running into. For some reason the tutor nor I could get the function call correctly. So we had to adjust a little bit to not call the function and print out the histogram in the 3rd switch statement and I accepted the loss in points for that as I knew it would happen. I have saved and added alot of pages from stackoverflow.com to help assist me in the future when running into issues like this again.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I feel this project would be a great reference point for when I have to work with two programming languages at once, as I have a feeling that I will be running into working with 2 or more languages down the road.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Well I kept it simple for myself as I am a beginer programmer, I was able to minimize functions so it dosent clutter up the programming so much when trying to debug or just simply follow the flow of how the project was running. Kept it with the best "industry standard" as I could, I testes every function I created to make sure it ran well and I didnt run into a debugging problem and I would not know where to start if I were to not test the functions as I went along with creating program.
